# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

I took the existing code from our client Horiseon to meet the acceptance criteria below and make it more accesible.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

If there are comments or tips, let me know.
